# My weekend to-do list
I am currently trying to _live my best life_ and learn as much as I can. I am trying to cook delicious food, keep a clean apartment and teach myself how to code. I am also trying to do this while working full time and save enough money to go back to school.
I am *strong and capable* of all of these things. In the mean time I am going to do all I can on my weekends. Here is what I need to do this weekend:

* Sweep floors
* Make bed
* Go to 11:11 store
* Listen to data stories podcast
* Make salad
* Go to movies with Yana
